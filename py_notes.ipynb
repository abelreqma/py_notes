    "The import keyword is used when modules and libraries are imported from other places into a Python program. Consider the math libary. To import all of the programs in the math  library, `import math` would be used. This, however, requires that everything referenced from the module be preceded by `math.[item]`. To get a specific function from the library, for example pi, `from math import pi` would have to be used. If pi were to be referenced anywhere in the program it does not need to be preceeded by math, and can be called directly using `pi`. If the programmer wants to call pi something else without having to rename it in the code, it can be imported as `from math import pi as π`. If this is done, the value of pi can be called as `π` immediately after importing it."

The basic idea of a set of if-elif-else statement is to find the first True condition in the set of if and elif headers and execute that associated suite. If no such True condition is found, the else code block is executed. If there are various if statements together with an else statement at the end, the else statement will be associated with the final if statement.

    "Besides these operators, comparison operators `>, <, ==, <=, >=, !=` can also be used as operators between two list operands. Similar to strings, comparison begins by comparing the first element of each list. If the first elements are equal, the comparison process moves to the second element of each list. This process continues, comparing corresponding elements until the process finds two elements that are different. At that point, the comparison between the two different elements determines the result of the operation.
